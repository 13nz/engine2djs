# 🧪 Custom Physics Engine in p5.js

A custom 2D physics engine built from scratch using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) framework. The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of physics simulation, including motion, collisions, and forces—without relying on any external physics libraries.

> 🚧 This project is currently a work in progress. Expect frequent changes and experimentation.

## 🚀 Features (In Progress)

- ✅ Vector-based movement and velocity
- ✅ Basic gravity and acceleration simulation
- ✅ Collision detection (circle vs. circle)
- 🛠️ Collision response (elastic & inelastic collisions)
- 🛠️ Wall boundaries and friction simulation
- 🧪 Force application system (e.g., user-controlled input or wind)
- 📈 Visual debugging tools (e.g. velocity arrows, collision indicators)

## 🎮 Demo

You can run the sketch using the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) or locally via a simple web server.
